                    student-centric learning. In this endeavor, the onus is on teachers to adopt personalized learning
                    and teaching patterns. Flexibility in learning is the keyword that governs the forthcoming tendency
                    of imparting quality education to students.!</p>

                The current face of Education in the nation is actually turning out to be a major “silent hindrance” for
                India’s track to greater development. While all the attention is on social-political issues, it should
                quickly be turned on to educational reforms. Education has the power to all solve issues(wars,
                unemployment, waste management, corruption etc), in the long run, and a must for a developing country
                like India it cannot be ignored, not to say it is being ignored, India spends a lot of Education(
                somewhat only 2nd after defence), the results aren’t actually visible….

                We need to completely revamp the system of education. Focus on work experience and adapting to a
                21st-century skill set should be on the key agenda list…

                For this, the first step is reducing the burden on kids by deleting stuf

                Parenting has always been a realization and reminiscence of the blissful days of our childhood. During
                our childhood, our parents made sure that we are more connected to the world and the people around us.
                While they led our little minds to explore and interact with the world, they gave us the wisdom to find
                the difference between the right and the wrong. They wanted us to learn from our mistakes and
                experiences. They gave us the freedom to build our own worlds which were much bigger and unique than
                today’s generation. Kids learn through experiences and not through words. They imitate what parents do.
                When their play is restricted, they tend to lean towards the electronic gadgets and start creating their
                own world of experience around them. Our kids need ‘smarter’ parents, not smartphones.

            <p class="sectionsubtag text-small">The year 2020 has been transformational for the education sector with
                the introduction of the National Education Policy (NEP) and COVID-19 pandemic has created considerable
                ambiguity for educators and students around the world leading to the stupendous growth and acceptance of
                online learning.

                The need to learn additional skills and become digitally focused, regardless of the type of industry in
                which you work, has become vital. Guided primarily by this demand for upskilling and re-skilling, the
                year 2021, will bring exponential growth for the edtech sector.
